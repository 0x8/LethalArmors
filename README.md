# Lethal Armor

This mod intends to add buyable armor for the player to increase their survivability among the normal maximum threshold.

The initial basic idea (which I'm sure I'll need to refine) is to add an "Armor Piece" upgrade to the terminal for the players to buy.
Each armor piece will be effectively worth 25 HP (1/4 of player health) by default and cost 100 each. Both of these values are meant to
be configurable so you can choose whatever you'd like.

The code here is likely a mess as its an amalgamation of what I'm learning from various sources. If I've done something egregious, please
feel free to point out what I did wrong and why. I'd love to learn more.

While I'm not even close to done and am still fleshing out this idea, I wanted to credit some of the following folks whose works I'm using
as references:

- Helo1223 - For the source of VoiceHUD which I'm using as a reference to figure out how to add a custom HUD element to indicate armor pieces
